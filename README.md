### Reddit Stalker Extension
Adds a quick way of getting all submissions from a user in any given subreddit. Want to check if user xx has any posts in gonew.. funny? Just choose that subreddit in the dropdown-box and there they are. Want to check if s/he has any submissions in *obscure-subreddit-xyz*? No worries, just add them in the extension and there you go.

Credits goes to https://github.com/Swader/ChromeSkel_a for bootstraping-purposes.
